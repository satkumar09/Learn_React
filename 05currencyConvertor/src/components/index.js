//this file just serves the purpose to export several component files in one go so that we can keep our App.jsx file clean
// import A from './A'
// import B from './A'
// import C from './A'
// export {A,B,C}

//so basically for any amount of component import in App.jsx we will only need 1 import

import InputBox from "./InputBox";

export { InputBox };
